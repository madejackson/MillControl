# MillControl - Arduino Coffee Grinder Control (time and weight)

If you speak german you can find a forum with some discussion here: 
https://www.kaffee-netz.de/threads/millcontrol-arduino-muehlensteuerung-mit-timer-gewichtsautomatik-und-brew-timer.95553/

07.12.2021 - Currently I am working on getting all the content from the forum to github

## Purpose of this project
This was designed to build a time controlled coffee grinder out of any regular machine. 
It was developed to be used with a Graef CM 70 but it should work fine with any brand or model.
During the development process a weight option was introduced as well.

Here are some examples on how it can look at the end:

### Requirements
 - Runs on Arduino Pro Mini & compatible systems (should be most arduino machines having a ATmega328 or better CPU, needs 32k of storage space).
 - Needs a rotary encoder with a switch and an optional second switch (mill switch). If you only have one switch comment out the define in UI.h
 - Output is to a 128*64 graphics display, comment out the orientation define in UI.h

### Dependencies:
- Encoder (v1.4) - http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
- TimerOne (v1.1) - https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne
- U8Glib - https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib

### Electronic schematic

I prefer a old school schmatic style over those fanzy fritzing pictures.

### User Interface

#### navigation overview
In this section I will insert a navigation overview for all user interaction.

#### Select a Time Mode
You can select from up to 20 time modes with settings for time or weight. 
There are two different time modes: multi selection and single selection (FLAT_MODE in UI.h).

##### multi selection
For every mode there are timeings for a single click, double click (or mill switch 2, if available) and long click.
For a click mode you can set a time / weight or "start/stop" (start mill with click start and stopping it at the next) or hold (longer click, only if more buttons are available).
If there is no mill button then you can only choose from single and double click. Long click is then bound to the edit menu.

###### Portrait mode

###### Landscape Mode

##### single selection
Every time / weight has its own side. With one click this site will be startet. In the direct mode ("start") will start the mill until another click stopps the mill, hold (the hold function also does something. But not clear what.).

###### Portrait mode
![SelectTimeWeightDirect](./Assets/pictures/scaleDirect_P.png)

###### Landscape Mode
![SelectTimeWeightDirect](./Assets/pictures/scaleDirect_L.png)

#### Settings
There is an extensive editor allowing you to change the mode (g + w), add a page (+), delete (x) and move (<>). 
Basically there are two modes: time and weights mode

##### time mode
For a time mode the respective times and the title are editable.

###### Portrait mode

###### Landscape Mode

##### weight mode
Alternativly there is a "weight mode automation". A grinde speed will be set in sec/gramms (which is basically also grind duration) and additional some weights. The titel of the page can also be edit.

###### automatic calibration
If you push the mill button inside the editor (or long press on the encoder button, if there is no mill button) the calibration will start.

- In order to start the calibration you should measure the amount of the cup to which you are going to grind the coffee. This will be used to train the scale.
- If the calibration is started the mill runs until the button is released (or if the button is pushed again, e.g. if you have only one button). You should grind at least one normal portion. More would be more accurate.
- After that the automatic will ask for the weight which was ground. Therefore you will need to measure it, select the weight on the menu and confirm with the encoder button.
- After that the grind-speed will be set automatically

###### Landscape Mode

#### Grind!
The grinding will start from the coresponding site with the correct button. If there is a programmed grind time or a weight, there will be a progress bar.
The grinding can be cancled any time by pushing the button which was used to start the grinding. If there is a programmed grindtime, the process will be stoped for 5 secounds and can be resumed with a new button push.
During the grind process the user can change the grind time by turning the turining button. This change will not be saved.

### Brew-Timer
If you set on A0 a button you can get a brew-timer. The timer will be cancled by any interaction and cannot be started during the milling process.
